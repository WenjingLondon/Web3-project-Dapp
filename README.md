  Maurice Token DApp

This is my very first Web3 practice project: **Maurice Token DApp**.

## Overview

Maurice Token DApp is a simple decentralized application that allows users to:
1. **Claim Tokens**: New accounts can claim 30 Maurice tokens (once only).
2. **Transfer Tokens**: Transfer Maurice tokens to other accounts by specifying the recipient's address.
3. **ContractAddress**: "0x8af7d1d8c3a31bf31fc47c9a2977be5e8d1fe29d"; 

The DApp is deployed and tested on the **Sepolia Testnet**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Web3-enabled browser (e.g., MetaMask installed and configured for Sepolia Testnet).
- Access to some Sepolia ETH to cover transaction fees (available from Sepolia faucets).

### How to Use
1. Open the DApp and connect your wallet.
2. Use the "Claim Tokens" feature to receive 30 Maurice tokens with a new wallet address.
3. Transfer tokens to another wallet address using the "Transfer" feature.

## Notes
- This project is strictly for learning and testing purposes.
- Please only interact with the application on the **Sepolia Testnet**.

- ### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open your browser and connect to the Sepolia Testnet using MetaMask.
